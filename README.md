# ZeroFall - React Native + Supabase App

프로젝트명 : ZeroFall(가제 : Safety Manager, 고소작업 사고 방지 대책)

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project with [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com) integration, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=20)
- Expo CLI
- Supabase account

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Get your project URL and API key from Project Settings > API
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Note**: If you get an error with `--legacy-peer-deps`, try:
```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Start the App

### Using Expo Go (Recommended)

1. Install Expo Go app on your phone
2. Run the development server:

```sh
npx expo start
```

3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app

### Using Web Browser

```sh
npx expo start --web
```

### Using iOS Simulator

```sh
npx expo run:ios
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
